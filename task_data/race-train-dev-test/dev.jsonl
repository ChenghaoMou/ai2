The goal of the project is to offer more than 10,000 children's electronic books in at least 100 languages. Some of the books show the similarities and differences in ways of life around the world. They will enable children to have a better understanding of other people's cultures. People working for this project have tried to design easy ways to search the collection and read the books. A picture of each page appears on the computer. Users can also print the pages on paper if they want to. The project is for two main groups of users. The first group is children between the ages of three and thirteen, along with their teachers and parents. The second group is researchers of children's literature .

Millennials are the new generation of young Americans. They were born between 1982 and 1992. There are 33 million of them, and they are just starting to enter the workforce . Many experts believe that millennials are different from young Americans of past generations. They also believe that millenials will change the workforce in important ways. How are millennials different? They are the first generation born in the computer age. The internet has always been a part of their lives. They spend about 16 hours a week on the Internet, and this doesn't include e-mail. And they spend 72 hours a week using other electronic media , including mobile phones and video games. They are \"nation speakers\" of the language of the computer age. People who were born earlier will never be native speakers of that language. Why not? They did not grow up \"speaking\" it. How will millennials change the workforce? To answer that question, it is important to understand how millennials use the Internet. They use the Internet to communicate. They visit website such as FaceBook and MySpace every day. They share ideas, music, information, games, and friendships with people all over the world. When they start working, they will want to share their work and ideas with others. It is also important to understand the way millennials grew up. Thair parents and teachers gave them a lot of attention. They taught them that their opinions were valuable . As a result, amny millennials are very cinfident. At work, they will expect their co-workers and bosses to listen to their opinions. Millennials also grew up with a lot of structure in their lives. Many of them went to school from the age of two or three and played on sports teams. At work, they will expect the rules to be clear. They will also expect a strong but fair boss, like a coach on a sports team. They will follow the person in charge if he or she is fair. But they will not follow an unfair boss. They will also expect their work to be fun and creative, similar to their experience on a sports team.

In 2012, Chinese people travelled abroad 30 percent more than in 2011. The prosperity of the tourism industry can also bring both our country and foreign countries great economic benefits . Chinese people usually join large tourist groups and visit several countries in one trip. Chinese people don't just travel for sightseeing. The China International Travel Service Company said that all their tour trips sold out a month before Christmas Day. Stores offered discounts during that time, so shopping in Europe and the United States is popular among Chinese travellers. In December, China is going through a very cold winter. So many people like to go to some countries in Southeast Asia because the weather there is quite pleasant. The improvement of living standards means more Chinese can travel abroad. But many of them don't have a sense of public manners. A report by Living Social website in March 2012 even listed Chinese as the world's second worst tourists. If you want to change that bad name, remember to avoid the following: littering, spitting, snatching bus seats, line-jumping, taking off shoes in public, talking loudly and smoking in non-smoking areas. Besides, we should learn some necessary manners of foreign countries.", "qa_list": ["What's the best title of the passage? Travelling", "What's the best title of the passage?

I was one of those runners. The race is called marathon . I had never run more than eight miles before, and here I was training. Since the race is in April, I had to run throughout the winter, and in Boston, winters are cold. For most people, just putting on their shirts, sweaters, jackets, and hats is exercise enough. I found myself out on the dark streets, running along ice sidewalks . Even in gloves, my fingers got so cold that they looked like red carrots. My nose didn't get warm until lunchtime ! Finally, the big day arrived. The weather was cold, with ice and rain. Bang! The gun sounded, and we started. I didn't go anywhere at first because I was standing behind so many people. I had to wait for them to move. At first, the running was easy. The other runners just seemed to pull me along. Somewhere around the 20-mile mark I even said to myself, \"This is nothing, why did I train so hard?\" Then I hit \"the wall\". \"The wall\" is what marathon runners call the special point. I knew my body reached the point and I thought I couldn't go any more. I was out of breath and my legs turned into pieces of wood. I was almost falling down.

And he tells you to call your cousin and to say happy birthday. And then he helps you with your homework. This is your future, and the robot's name is NAO. NAO has a small body, big eyes and a large head. He can walk and dance. He listens and talks, and he even learns and thinks for himself. His creators predict that the robot will be in people's homes before 2040. This $16,000 robot knows who you are. NAO can even express emotions . He is a self-guided robot. A self-guided robot can sense , think and act. Other robots might do two out of the three.

Post-it Notes, the pieces of paper that you can fasten almost anywhere and then remove without leaving any sign that they were there, are an example of such an invention. Post-it Notes were invented about twenty years ago by Art Fry, a scientist at 3M Corporation. The idea for the product came from a frustrating experience he often had while singing in his church choir. Fry used pieces of paper as bookmarks to mark the places in his book of songs, but these bookmarks were always falling out. He knew he needed a bookmark that would stay where he put it, but that he could remove without damaging the pages. Around that time, Fry heard about a new adhesive that a workmate, Dr. Spence Silver, had created. This adhesive was special because it was sticky, but not too sticky. It was strong enough to hold papers together, but weak enough to not tear the paper when it was removed. Fry saw that the new adhesive could help solve his bookmark problem. One morning, Fry put some of the adhesive on the edge of a piece of paper. Just as he hoped, it made a perfect bookmark. A short time later, Fry realized that his new invention had even more uses than being a great bookmark. He came to this realization when he wrote a note on one of his new \"bookmarks\" and attached it to a report he was going to give to a workmate. Soon, co-workers were asking Fry for more samples of his invention so that they could use the new type of notes themselves.

Of course, many of us know we may eat the whole thing in the end. It isn't just girls. Most of us find it hard to say 'no' to something attractive, However, scientists now say that willpower is very important to success and a happy life. Scientists in different countries have been studying the effects of willpower on people's lives for a long time.

What's the difference between fog and smog? According to scientists, fog is made up of tiny drops of water and also ice particles during very cold conditions. Smog is dirty air that looks like a mixture of smoke and fog, caused mainly by smoke from cars and factories in cities. An official for the Ministry of Environmental Protection told Beijing News that PM2.5 pollution is the main problem with air pollution. PM 2.5 refers to pollution with small particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter . According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, two main factors that cause PM 2.5 are motor vehicles and the burning of coal. Poor air has done harm to people's health. Children and the elderly are more at risk. A report from Beijing Children's Hospital shows that from January 5 to January 11, 2013, half of the patients in the hospital came for respiratory problems. To respond to the air problem, the Chinese government and many Chinese people have started to take action. Beijing announced a plan to use clean fuel in government vehicles and plant trees. It asked citizens to set off fewer fireworks for the Spring Festival celebration. They suggested that cars with large emissions should be banned and factories should be closely watched. Three students from No. 4 High School in Beijing wrote a report to advise to fight the air pollution. \"We hope more people will join us to protect our environment.

It is said that the tradition of lighting birthday candles was invented by the ancient Greeks; it has taken on different meanings through the years. Today, one of the most popular birthday traditions is to blow out the candles all at once to make a secret wish come true. In order to please Artemis, the goddess of the moon, the ancient Greeks arranged something special for birthdays. A moon-shaped cake was baked and decorated with lit candles.

The tradition of lighting birthday candles continued in Europe, where candles were sometimes kept burning all day on a person's birthday, partly as celebration and partly to keep away evil spirits. It was believed that the blowing out of candles represented one's prayers to the gods. Some cultures believe it is a bad luck to blow out the candles until after the evening meal is eaten. Traditionally, one candle represents a year of the person's age. Some families prefer to add an extra candle for good luck.

The king sent a group of messengers to inform the villagers that they must remove the fence.Upon hearing that the king was planning to do this,however,the villagers developed a plan of their own.When the king's messengers arrived,they were met by the villagers pretending to be mad.The people just throw things and ran around wildly.The messengers were surprised by this and reported to King John that these people were so mad that there was no necessity of punishing them.So,the villagers saved their farmland by tricking the king.In Great Britain,tradition only allows April Fool's tricks from midnight to noon on April l.Those who try to play tricks in the afternoon become the fools themselves.", "qa_list": ["From the passage we can know that April Fool's Day is very popular in Asian countries .", "From the passage we can know that according to the English story,April Fool's Day began sometime during the 1300s .", "From the passage we can know that according to the English story,King John of England was in the habit of making a building .", "From the passage we can know that according to the English story,the citizens of one particular farm village were against what the king did ."]}

However, in 1932, Adele Astaire married a British man, and stopped performing. But Fred did not give up his dream. He would go on alone, in the movies. Fred said, \"Dancing is a sweaty job. You cannot just sit down and do it. You have to get up on your feet. It takes time to get a dance right, to create something memorable. I always try to get to know my dance so well that I do not have to think.\" In 1949, Fred Astaire won a special award for his film work from America's Motion Picture Academy. He also won awards from the television industry for a number of his television programs.[:ZXXK] Fred stopped dancing in 1970. He was more than seventy years old at the time.

Tom lives with his aunt Polly in a quiet street of St. Petersburg, Missouri. He's a lively and clever young boy, and he finds himself in many exciting adventures . He runs away with his friends, Huck Finn and Joe, to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River for several days. With Huck he goes looking for treasure, with Becky he gets lost in a cave and finally they find a box of gold. My favourite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead. He decides to go to his town funeral. He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is surprised to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive. Tom is the hero of the story, but there are another important characters. Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him . Becky is pretty with fair hair, Joe is Tom's best friend and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story. The theme of the story is about children growing up. It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom, social rules and how people are punished for bad behavior. Why do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876, but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story. Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in the 19thcentury, so it sounds very real. Today it's thought to be one of the greatest books in American literature.

He decides to go to his town funeral. He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is surprised to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive. Tom is the hero of the story, but there are another important characters. Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him . Becky is pretty with fair hair, Joe is Tom's best friend and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story. The theme of the story is about children growing up.

However, things went from bad to worse in March 2015 after heavy rains damaged the only power cables in the area. The villagers were forced to use oil lamps, which are not only expensive but also dangerous because of the harmful gases they produce. Luckily, researchers at the University of Technology (UT) in Lima, Peru heard about their problem and found a wonderful solution. They made a lamp that can be powered by plants and soil, both of which can be easily found in the Amazonian rainforest where the village lies. The lamp takes energy from a plant growing in a wooden box and uses it to light up an LED light bulb. While that may sound amazing and even impossible, the science behind the ides is quite simple. As plants create their food (using the sun's energy, water and chemicals from the soil), they also produce waste which they return to the soil. Tiny animals in the soil eat this waste and they produce electrons - the building blocks of electrical energy. The UT team put special sticks inside the soil to capture the energy and keep it in the lamp's batteries for later use. The researchers say a single charge can power a 50-watt Led light for two hours - enough time for local villagers to get their evening work done. The university gave ten Plant Lamps to the villagers of Nuevo Saposoa in October 2015. So far, they have been a huge success!

There he spent much time reading and thinking, which greatly helped him with his writing. On the other hand, his life experiences gave him wonderful material to write about and attract readers.

It made the perfect place for him to study and get to know the nature. He had seen some red-tail hawks, red foxes, wood turtles and other animals. He also found special native flowers. Suddenly it was announced that the \"empty\" land would be improved by a lot of houses on it. The plants would be removed, the animals would run away and most would probably die. Then the wet soil would be covered with extra grounds. When he heard about the news, he was not happy. He was very worried that the land ans water would be polluted. Andrew wrote down clearly all the research he had down about the area, and how the houses would affect the local environment. He sent letters to members of local government and television reporters.

But according to a latest survey, more than 90% of Americans regularly use a computer or some other kinds of electronic products in the hour before bed. Researchers are finding that man-made light from some electronic products at night may reduce the brain chemicals that help sleep. The researchers showed that sitting in the light from computer tablets clearly lowered levels of the chemical which manages our body clocks and plays a role in the sleep cycle. In the study, the researchers let volunteers read, play games and watch movies on a tablet for different time while measuring how much light their eyes received. They found that two hours of sitting before a bright tablet screen at night reduced the sleep chemical levels by about 22%. Studies of students using computers at night have got the similar results. And researchers say _ may not only cause sleeplessness, but also raise the risk of obesity , diabetes and other diseases.
