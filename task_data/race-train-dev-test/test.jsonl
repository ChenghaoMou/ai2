Do you argue whether it's cold outdoors or whether the car in front of you is going faster than the speed limit ? If you get into such arguments, try to think about the story about the six blind men and the elephant. The first blind man who felt the elephant's trunk said it was like a snake. The second who felt the elephant's side said it was like a wall, while the third said it was like a spear( ) as he touched the animal's tusk. The fourth, who took hold of the elephant's tail, insisted that it was like a rope. The fifth man said it looked like a tree as he put his arms around one of the elephant's legs. The last, who was tall and got hold of the elephant's ears, said it was like a huge fan. Each man's idea of the animal came from his own experience. So if someone disagrees with you about a \"simple fact\", it's often because his experience in the matter is different from yours. To see how hard it is for even one person to make up his mind about a \"simple fact\", try this simple experiment. Get three large bowls. Put ice water in one. Put hot water in the second. Put lukewarm water in the third. Now put your left hand in the hot water. Put your right hand in the lukewarm water. Your right hand will tell you the water is cold. Your left hand will tell you it is hot.", "qa_list": ["It can be inferred from the passage that we should learn from the blind men .", "It can be inferred from the passage that we should not agree about simple facts .", "It can be inferred from the passage that we should never think about simple facts .", "It can be inferred from the passage that we should never decide anything with one side ."]}

Then, about six months after she arrived, I felt that something in my heart was taking place, and I was unable to stop it. My behaviour began to change. I began to smile at people when passing them in a street. I returned from neighbours. I started calling my kids, and to my surprise, they started calling me. I even tried to speak to my grandchildren over the phone once. I even was glad to listen to laughter from a 10-month-old granddaughter. The point is that I was changing. My wife and I both agree that it is Gertie who has changed my behaviour. Gertie is now nearly two years old and almost fully grown.I have come to like the pet little by little, though she is my wife's dog.", "qa_list": ["What can we learn from this passage?

There is no place here for you.\" Sadness was close by, so Love asked, \"Sadness, let me go with you .\" \"Oh, Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!\" Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even notice when Love called her. Suddenly, there was a voice, \"Come, Love, I will take you.\" It was an elder. Love was so excited that she even forgot to ask who the elder was. So Love asked Knowledge, another elder, \"Who helped me?\" \"It was Time,\" Knowledge answered. \"Time?\" asked Love. \"But why did Time help me?\" Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and answered, \"Because only Time understands how _ Love is.\"", "qa_list": ["Who helped Love out of danger?

Some birds like eating locusts , but birds cannot easily catch them. Why? It is because locusts change their colurs with the changes of the colours of crops .When crops are green, locusts look green .But as the harvest time comes, locusts change into the same brown colour as crops have .Some other pests whose colours are different from plants are easily found and eaten by others .So they have to hide themselves for lives and appear only at night. If you study the animals' life, you'll find the main use of colours is to protect themselves .Bears, lions and other animals move quietly through forests .They cannot be easily seen by hunters because their colours are much like the trees.

She would gladly walk miles to school, but her mother needs her badly at home. What will her future be? Is it hard to believe? For Maria Pestora, it is real life. But with just 52 pennies a day, you can sponsor a child like Maria. Through\"Save the Children\",you can help Maria's mother get the tools and ways she needs to turn their poor food into a good dinner, and get the money she needs to buy clothes and school things for Maria. To help Maria most, your money is put together with that of other sponsors. Building schools, hospitals, bringing in clean water is what\"Save the Children\"has been working on since 1932. For you there are many rewards. You have the chance to write to or hear from the child you sponsored, to receive photos or progress reports, to know you are reaching out to another person, not with a handout , but a hand up. That's how \"Save the Children\" works. But without you, it can't work. Please take a moment now to fill in and post the form below to help a child like Maria.

One day, a terrible sound attracted his attention in the town market. He saw a young bull for sale. The bull was white and yellow. It was looking at Tom in fear. Tom walked up and touched its head gently. Just at that time they both seemed to have known each other for a long time. How amazing!Tom bought it at once and called it Amba. From then on , Tom and Amba got on well with each other. But some friends told him that it was dangerous to have such a close relationship with an animal. One afternoon , Tom was walking through the forest with Amba. Suddenly , Amba stopped walking and kept pushing Tom with its head. Tom was very surprised and looked around. There was a big snake in front of him. It was beautiful but poisonous.

Students are still taught to read notation so they can recite compositions that they would never listen to on their MP3 players or play with friends. Playing music enriches life. The question is: Why do schools teach music in a way that _ so many young people rather than catch their imagination? Can we do a better job of using the power of music to get kids excited about school? The experience of an organization called Little Kids Rock suggests the answer is yes -- if we change the way music is taught. Little Kids Rock has helped music programs in over a thousand public schools and served 150,000 children. The organization has given 30,000 free instruments out, mainly guitars, and trained 1,500 teachers to run music classes in which students quickly experience the joys of playing their favorite songs, performing in bands , and writing their own music. The key to Little Kids Rock is that it teaches children to play music the way many musicians learn to play it -- not by notation, but by listening, imitation and meaningful experimentation. \"The knowledge you need to get started playing rock music is very limited,\" explains Dave Wish, the founder of Little Kids Rock. \"In high school, my friend Paul taught me a couple of chords and my life was changed forever. On the first day of class, Little Kids Rock teachers place guitars in the hands of their students and get them practicing chords that will enable them to play thousands of songs. The kids decide what songs they want to learn and the class is off and running. Their progress is surprising. Within a year, eight and nine-year-olds are playing musical instruments, and giving concerts, even performing their own songs. One of the biggest advantages that music offers is the ability to encourage students who are otherwise bored by school. \"I've had students start coming back to school because of this program,\" said Adkison Thomas, who heads up music for the Dallas Independent School District. He added, \"One of the best things is that the teachers discover a new side of their students. They see kids become successful who weren't before.\"", "qa_list": ["How did Little Kids Rock help the school? By writing music for kids.", "How did Little Kids Rock help the school?

The kids decide what songs they want to learn and the class is off and running. Their progress is surprising. Within a year, eight and nine-year-olds are playing musical instruments, and giving concerts, even performing their own songs. One of the biggest advantages that music offers is the ability to encourage students who are otherwise bored by school. \"I've had students start coming back to school because of this program,\" said Adkison Thomas, who heads up music for the Dallas Independent School District. He added, \"One of the best things is that the teachers discover a new side of their students. They see kids become successful who weren't before.\"", "qa_list": ["Little Kids Rock is successful because it encourages kids to experience music .", "Little Kids Rock is successful because it helps kids learn from great musicians .", "Little Kids Rock is successful because it allows kids to decide how to learn music .", "Little Kids Rock is successful because it offers musical programs all over the country ."]}
{"index": 27753, "id": "middle5092.txt", "paragraph": "Music education hasn't changed much since the 1970s. Students are still taught to read notation so they can recite compositions that they would never listen to on their MP3 players or play with friends. Playing music enriches life. The question is: Why do schools teach music in a way that _ so many young people rather than catch their imagination? Can we do a better job of using the power of music to get kids excited about school? The experience of an organization called Little Kids Rock suggests the answer is yes -- if we change the way music is taught. Little Kids Rock has helped music programs in over a thousand public schools and served 150,000 children. The organization has given 30,000 free instruments out, mainly guitars, and trained 1,500 teachers to run music classes in which students quickly experience the joys of playing their favorite songs, performing in bands , and writing their own music.

A big building overlooks the town and it is one of the most beautiful in the whole country. To the north of the town there is a high mountain standing in the country. The town is very beautiful, with its many craft shops and narrow cobbled streets. Most travelers visit Kinsale for its fish restaurants, which are family owned.

{"index": 28018, "id": "middle6794.txt", "paragraph": "Choose the best answer. Choose the best answer(,, A, B, CD): Can kids make their own newspapers? They do in Paris. Student editors at a French newspaper for kids called \"Mon Quotidien\", do every day. The 10-year-old newspaper has its headquarters in Paris. Sometimes the newspaper sells 200,000 copies every day. It gets more than one million dollars every year! This is much more than other newspapers. How do they decide what to put in the paper? All the adult editors working on the children's daily agree that the paper should be easy and simple to read. Kids should be able to finish it within 10 minutes. The paper covers school life, animals, and science, which are usually kid's favourite subjects. It also talks about big world problem, like the Iraq war. In order to make the paper more popular with kids, adult editors invite students from age 10 to 15 to take part in their meetings. They have meetings every Wednesday and Sunday. Adult editors, reporters and kids sit together and decide which topics should come out in the paper and on which page.

The earlier they can break free, the more meaning they can make out of their lives. Second, It is a waste of people's talents and social resources if they don't get to do the things they are most talented at. Some people don't want to be white-collar workers all their lives.

The teacher is a good example. No---People can't change their lives overnight. First, \"Seeing the world\" is not good enough an excuse to leave one's job and life. This kind of attitude could actually be a bad example for young people. Second, Everyone has a place in society and life. People may not have achieved their wildest or most ambitious dreams, but where they end up is the result of their and society's decisions.

{"index": 28168, "id": "middle7622.txt", "paragraph": "The resignation letter of Gu Shaoqiang, a teacher from Henan, \"The world is so big; I want to see it.\" is very popular in the Internet. Many people say that it spoke the minds of millions of people who feel they have been in a boring and normal life and want to do something different to change it. Whatever the teacher may be able to achieve with her life, it is meaningful for people to make their dream come true. So, what is your opinion? Should we praise the teacher for resigning and following her dreams? Yes---All of us have dreams that can't come true right now. First, Too many people waste their lives by doing things they don't love simply because it is what people expect them to do. They are not happy and they also affect people around them. The earlier they can break free, the more meaning they can make out of their lives. Second, It is a waste of people's talents and social resources if they don't get to do the things they are most talented at. Some people don't want to be white-collar workers all their lives. They should have the freedom to change their lives. Third, As our country develops so fast, people have greater freedom to change their lives as long as they put in the time and effort. The teacher is a good example. No---People can't change their lives overnight. First, \"Seeing the world\" is not good enough an excuse to leave one's job and life. This kind of attitude could actually be a bad example for young people. Second, Everyone has a place in society and life. People may not have achieved their wildest or most ambitious dreams, but where they end up is the result of their and society's decisions. Unless they offer to make lots of efforts and sacrifices, people can't change their lives _ Third, The reason why the teacher gave up her job is too unclear. It is too irresponsible.", "qa_list": ["Some people disagree that we should praise the teacher except It is just an excuse to run away from the job and life.", "Some people disagree that we should praise the teacher except Everyone has a social place and each should makes efforts to change lives step by step.", "Some people disagree that we should praise the teacher except If someone wants to leave the job, it is polite and necessary to tell your reasons instead of one piece of easy sentence.", "Some people disagree that we should praise the teacher except People have freedom to change their lives, the teacher sets a good example."]}

First of all, let's see what train-spotting is. It is said that there are some 100,000 train spotters in the UK. Exactly as the title suggests, they spot trains, that is, they stand in train stations, look at the number of each train that leaves and arrives and write it down.

The eventual aim is to have seen every train in the country. Being crazy about railways and trains is not modern and it dates back to 1804. As the number of trains grew and they got faster and faster, so did the interest in them grow? Is this any stranger than people who love cars? So, what do you need to be a train-spotter? Well, all you really need is a pen or pencil and a notebook to write down the train numbers. Other equipment includes hot tea in a thermos, a camera and some sandwiches for those long afternoons spent on train platforms when you don't want to risk the delights of railway station food. It's interesting to note that despite the \"bad name\" of train-spotting, there have been famous railway lovers in history, such as Alfred Hitchcock, who filmed them regularly, especially The 39 Steps. There is evidence, too, that being a train-spotter is not necessarily a strange phenomenon in Britain. One glance at the US train stations should be enough to convince you that train-spotters there are alive and well. In America, they try to call rail lovers \"train-fans\" and talk of \"train-fanning\". Don't let this fool you--these people are train spotters and there are a lot of them.

Research shows that if you eat a meal in the morning you may not become too fat or eat too much during lunch. Eating breakfast can help people feel better through the day. Get enough sleep. Poor sleep can influence our memory and learning. It can also cause traffic accidents! Studies show that people who don't get enough sleep seem to get into more accidents. So stay safe and get enough sleep! Take a walk every day. Walking is an easy way to exercise. You'd better meet friends for a walk, not for a meal. As you walk, you will see the beautiful world around you. Once you try, you will find that adding a walk into your daily life is very easy. Join social groups. Social groups can provide support. They might include sport teams, art or music groups. The people in the group can offer advice and can help each other in difficult times. Also, being in a group keeps your mind busy. An active mind is a healthy mind! Have a hobby. A hobby could be running reading or making something with your hands. Hobbies help people to relax and rest.

For example, the music you like may sound like noise to them. Your parents love you, so they feel they must stop you from doing whatever they find strange. On the other hand, you don't want to be different from other teenagers, so you feel that your parents you. I think you should talk about this problem with your parents. Try to explain to them what you want and make them know they can believe you. And then they'll find you are a responsible person and they will give you more freedom.
