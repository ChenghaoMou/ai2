{"context": "Indonesia delays execution of convicts including Indian on death row JAKARTA, March 27 (AFP) Indonesia will delay the execution of six convicts including an Indian on death row after five of them appealed to the Supreme Court for a second review, prosecutors said Thursday. \"If we execute them now we can't bring them to life again should their appeals for a review be granted,\" said Antasari Azhar, spokesman for the attorney general's office. The Supreme Court rejected earlier appeals for a case review from five of the convicts. The sixth offender has only made one appeal for a review. President Megawati Sukarnoputri has refused clemency for the six and asked for a speedy execution. Five of them are Indonesians convicted of murders while the other is an Indian drug offender, Ayodhya Prasad Chaubey. \"We are talking about someone's life or death so we have to be very careful,\" Azhar said. A convict can file a case review or appeal for presidential clemency only after the Supreme Court upholds a sentence imposed by a lower court. Apart from those convicted of murder, 16 people are on death row for drug trafficking -- 11 foreigners, four Indonesians and a Dutch citizen of Chinese-Indonesian origin. Indonesian courts have increasingly handed out severe sentences, including death, for drug smugglers. Narcotics abuse is an increasingly serious problem in the country. Amnesty International has appealed to Indonesia to spare the lives of convicted drug offenders and others, saying there was no proof the death penalty deters would-be traffickers more effectively than other punishments. Amnesty opposes the death penalty for any crime.

Anwar, 56, who this week completed four years in prison on a corruption charge, now faces an earliest possible release date of April 14, 2009 if he is given one third remission of his sentence for good behaviour.

Within weeks he was arrested and charged with sodomising an official driver several years previously and with abusing his powers to cover up the offence. The conduct of the trials was widely criticised internationally and the United States still lists Anwar as a political prisoner.

She will be the Registration Manager for the Houston Center, accountable for causing registrations into the Landmark Forum. I know this is a huge commitment for her, and I am excited about the difference she will make in my life, my family, and in the lives of the people in this part of the world.

If you have hobbies, the hobbies are about making a difference in the world. This is not an easy thing to take on. The mountain is very steep and hard to climb. It is also incredibly rewarding and fulfilling and gives purpose and meaning to your life.

Well, they are close enough up to Baghdad now so that the supply line issue is probably not a big one since they had time to restock, food, fuel and ammunition. So, probably the main thing is combing through the rubble that the air force has left of these Republican Guard divisions to make sure there are no strong points that you leave behind, that could threaten your lines of supply once they get past. Once they are satisfied they are through all that, I would imaging there will be a pause while they start to reconnoiter into Baghdad, probing hard to see how much resistance there really is. Well, let me ask you that. First of all, I just wanted to tell viewers where we just took our satellite imagery. This is that Karbala area which is about 50 miles from Baghdad.

The Supreme Court rejected earlier appeals for a case review from five of the convicts. The sixth offender has only made one appeal for a review. President Megawati Sukarnoputri has refused clemency for the six and asked for a speedy execution. Five of them are Indonesians convicted of murders while the other is an Indian drug offender, Ayodhya Prasad Chaubey. \"We are talking about someone's life or death so we have to be very careful,\" Azhar said. A convict can file a case review or appeal for presidential clemency only after the Supreme Court upholds a sentence imposed by a lower court. Apart from those convicted of murder, 16 people are on death row for drug trafficking -- 11 foreigners, four Indonesians and a Dutch citizen of Chinese-Indonesian origin. Indonesian courts have increasingly handed out severe sentences, including death, for drug smugglers. Narcotics abuse is an increasingly serious problem in the country. Amnesty International has appealed to Indonesia to spare the lives of convicted drug offenders and others, saying there was no proof the death penalty deters would-be traffickers more effectively than other punishments.

Meanwhile, the U.S. military faced sharp criticism over assaults that killed three foreign journalists. Pentagon officials said Tuesday they didn't know whether Iraqi President Saddam Hussein died in the U.S. airstrike on a Baghdad neighborhood the day before. The strike destroyed three nearby houses and killed at least two people. U.S. Marines battled snipers as they fought deeper into the capital from the east. They seized the Rasheed Airport and captured enough ammunition for an estimated 3,000 troops. Ominously, they also took a prison where they found U.S. Army uniforms and chemical weapons suits possibly belonging to American POWs. Some army units routed Iraqi fighters from a Republican Guard headquarters inside the capital. Others discovered a 12-room complex inside a cave, complete with white marble floors and fluorescent lighting. Members of the U.S. Army's V Corps opened up a new front by entering Baghdad from the north. The toll on Iraqi civilians four days after Americans first penetrated the Baghdad outskirts is unknown. But the World Health Organization said Baghdad's hospitals were running out of supplies to treat the burns, shrapnel wounds and spinal injuries caused by the fighting. Iraqi officials, however, remained defiant, saying Iraq's forces would never surrender to American forces: ``They will be burnt,'' said Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf.
