Several hours later, dozens of Israeli tanks advanced into the northern Gaza Strip backed by helicopters which fired at least three rockets in the Jabaliya area, Palestinian security sources said. Palestinian medical sources said 60-year-old Mohammed al-Biyari was killed in his home near Jabaliya refugee camp by the rocket fire and another wounded. A second rocket landed in farmlands and the other hit a house inside the refugee camp, but without causing further casualties, Palestinian security sources said. Two 13-year-old children were among those killed in the Haifa bus bombing, Israeli public radio said, adding that most of the victims were youngsters. The army said two soldiers were also among the dead. The bus was ripped to shreds while travelling between a residential area and Haifa university. Of the 33 injured still in hospital late Wednesday, two were in intensive care and six others in serious condition, the radio said.

In the January attack, two Palestinian suicide bombers blew themselves up in central Tel Aviv, killing 23 other people. Israeli government spokesman Avi Pazner called the latest deadly blast a \"very grave attack\" and said the Jewish state would take \"vigorous action against the terrorist organisations\".

Judge Shahid Rafiq, of the district court in the industrial city of Faisalabad, found Ranjha Masih guilty of defiling Koranic verses during a protest rally by the minority Christian community in 1998. In a verdict handed down on Saturday, the judge also ordered Ranjha to pay a fine of 50,000 rupees (about 870 US dollars), they said. Ranjha was accused of tearing down a billboard carrying verses from the Koran in Faisalabad during a Christian demonstration after the city's bishop committed suicide over the 1985 blasphemy law. Faisalabad's Catholic Bishop John Joseph, who had been campaigning against the law, shot himself in the head outside a court in Sahiwal district when the judge convicted Christian Ayub Masih under the law in 1998. Ayub Masih was charged in 1996 with blasphemy for allegedly defending British author Salman Rushdie, whose novel \"The Satanic Verses\" infuriated radical Mulsim clerics who accused the author of defaming Islam.

In court papers filed this week in state Supreme Court in New York, Welch requested a deposition next month of David Heleniak, a senior partner in the law firm of Shearman & Sterling in New York. He also wants to subpoena all documents maintained in Jane Beasley Welch's personnel file by Shearman & Sterling, a prestigious corporate law firm where she worked before she married Welch. Welch specifically is seeking performance evaluations, correspondence between his estranged wife and partners while she worked at the law firm's office in London, and documents related to her prospects of becoming a partner. Welch also wants details on Jane Beasley Welch's salary, benefits, retirement plan and other compensation paid to her. Michael York, one of Jack Welch's attorneys, called the move routine. A judge ruled in February that depositions in the divorce case will remain confidential. Earlier documents in the case have included embarrassing details about perks Welch received as part of his retirement package from GE at a time when corporate scandals were sparking outrage. The court order was requested by Jack Welch's attorney, Daniel K. Webb, who said Welch would likely be asked about his business dealings, his health and entries in his personal diary.

In 1999, East Timor became free, but only after Indonesian forces laid waste to it as they withdrew after a pro-independence referendum. The shocking level of destruction prompted U.S. lawmakers to expand the ban to cover almost all military ties with Indonesia. Since then some in the Bush administration _ particularly Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, a former ambassador to Jakarta and a prime architect of the Iraq war _ have pushed for the ban to be repealed.

Failure to pay the fine would result in a two-month extension of the suspension.

The court convicted the paper of violating article 25 of the Press Law, which prohibits the publication of material that defames religion or incites religiously unacceptable activity.

It's very simple. And so you do what you're trained to do. You do what you're there to do. And, in Vietnam, it was body count. Training is what keeps you running toward the front while trucks loaded with dead bodies pass you, going the other way. It's hard to explain what training can do. Training sets your mind to respond not to common sense and judgment, but to training. You really don't have time to think: I'm going the wrong way. I should be going the other way.

Let's get the very latest from the Pentagon for the overall war picture as they see it. Our Jamie McIntyre our senior military affairs correspondent is with us now. Hello, again, Jamie. Well Judy, the Pentagon is beginning to see positive signs that it hadn't seen for awhile. First of all, as we saw just a few moments ago on CNN, the pictures of some of the actual happy Iraqi citizens welcoming U.S. troops, that taking place in Najaf. Also the Pentagon is seeing lighter than expected resistance indicating at least that they may have really seriously degraded those Republican Guard divisions before the U.S. troops arrived, both in Karbala and also in Al Kut. They met lighter than expected resistance. But the Pentagon officials stress that as they close in on Baghdad, this becomes the real dangerous part as they enter that so- called red zone where Saddam Hussein is believed to have given his commanders authority to use chemical weapons, and that use of chemical weapons remains a real fear at the Pentagon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) We are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it in a coup de mains, or anything like that.

For a look at what might lie ahead for U.S. forces, let's turn to our Miles O'Brien in Atlanta. Thank you very much, Judy. To help guide us through all this discussion about red zones, and daggers and exactly what is the strength of the Republican Guard, we turn to Colonel Patrick Lang. He's retired with the United States Army. He spent some time in the Defence Intelligence Agency, among other things. Colonel, good to have you with us. You're welcome. What do you suppose right now would be the governor on the forward advance? Is it the Republican Guard or is it the U.S. and coalition supply lines? Or both? Well, they are close enough up to Baghdad now so that the supply line issue is probably not a big one since they had time to restock, food, fuel and ammunition. So, probably the main thing is combing through the rubble that the air force has left of these Republican Guard divisions to make sure there are no strong points that you leave behind, that could threaten your lines of supply once they get past. Once they are satisfied they are through all that, I would imaging there will be a pause while they start to reconnoiter into Baghdad, probing hard to see how much resistance there really is.

I mean a feature of that importance would always be something you'd want to hold. And besides, as soon as you get control of it you'd be able to start using it for air operations, and put a survey team in there as soon as it's secured, and then start using it for helicopter operations, haul forward some big bladders of fuel to refuel helicopters and rearm them and things like that. And if the front stabilizes between there and the downtown Baghdad, they'll start using it for a fixed wing aircraft as well. Now, as you go from Saddam International Airport into town you see there are some big, wide divided highways there. Control of these highways will be crucial won't it? Yeah, these are the high-speed approaches into the heart of the city and armored forces like the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division just love high-speed approaches. They will try to go down those things, cutting the city up into sectors as best they can, and then work on the specific sectors of the city they think are a key terrain. I would think, probably, various facilities as well as major government buildings that they need to control to set up a new government. It's a big city, about the size of Philadelphia or thereabouts.

Well, it depends on the attitude of the populous, which is not clear yet. If the population, in fact, or at least a big part of them like the Shia half of the population, if they want to be liberated, then you can control them with a fairly small force. If, in fact, a lot of people in the city don't want to be liberated and you're never going to know that until you try, then you're going to need a much larger force, and we might end up waiting a couple of weeks for reinforcements. Based on what you've seen so far, what is your sense of that? The Shias are a bit gun shy, if you will, in the south because of what happened in 1991. They rose up, didn't get American support. Do you suppose it will be a different story in Baghdad? Is there a lot of latent hatred for Saddam Hussein that will come out? Yes, there is, but these folks are going to be mighty cautious.

Well, U.S. officials are investigating two possible friendly fire incidents in which coalition forces may have mistakenly shot at allied aircraft. In one of the incidents, a soldier was killed and several others wounded. Before word of that death, 40 Americans had been killed by hostile fire in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Eleven of them by friendly fire or in other accidents. Most of the 27 British troops killed have been victims of friendly fire or accidents. Meantime, Iraq says that 420 civilians, they say, have been killed during the war. And they say 4,000 injured. U.S. officials say more than 4,000 Iraqis have been captured. Seven Americans we know remain prisoners of war in Iraq. Fifteen others are said to be still missing in action.

Michael Kelly, of course, with \"Atlantic Monthly,\" and a columnist for the \"Washington Post.\" Well, at least three U.S. service members were killed today in an apparent suicide bomb attack at a checkpoint near the Haditah Dam northwest of Baghdad. Those deaths are not yet included in the official casualty count. At last report, though, 41 Americans had been killed by hostile forces, 13 others by friendly fire or in accidents. Of the 27 British troops, in all who have been killed, at least 19 of them were said to be victims of friendly fire or accidents. The official Iraqi casualty figures remain the same this day, including more than 400 civilians killed, Iraqi authorities say.

What we're hearing from Iraqi people in the capital today is that they know and they have seen coalition forces in the southwest of the city, in the southeast of the city. They say they have also seen coalition forces and believe coalition forces have a checkpoint on the northern outskirts of Baghdad as well. So as far as the Iraqi people are concerned, they are very aware that coalition forces are right on the perimeter of the city. Our sources are also telling us that Iraqi forces are massing artillery pieces and tanks at a number of locations on the southwestern edge of the city. These locations, actually, very close to the center of Baghdad and appear to be forming something sort of front line against the coalition forces. Now, Iraq's minister of information today said that the coalition did not have control of the airport, that this was some sort of contrived video from the first day, and that, in fact, hundreds of coalition soldiers had been killed, and their graves were now at the airport. He did promise to take journalists to the airport, however, he never made -- he didn't make good on that promise throughout the day.
