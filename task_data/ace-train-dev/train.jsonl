Plans to bring supplies to Iraqi civilians had been on hold for days because of fighting across southern Iraq. On Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned U.S. national security adviser Condoleezza Rice that the United States is legally responsible for providing relief aid. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer blamed Saddam Hussein's regime for slowing the flow of US$105 million in U.S. aid by placing mines in the port of Umm Qasr. U.S. Navy helicopters flew two dolphins  _  Makai and Tacoma  _ into Umm Qasr, where they were to begin ferreting out mines Wednesday. Royal Marine commandos carried out an overnight sweep around the port, searching for Iraqi holdouts. The British said they had enough control over the area to begin sending in ships. A British ship, the Sir Galahad, moved into position at the mouth of the Khor Abdallah river Tuesday night with 211 tons of food and 101 tons of bottled water. It was to begin the six-hour journey into Umm Qasr on Wednesday, according to a pool report. Iraqis have about five weeks of food left, according to estimates by the World Food Program.

{"context": "Report: Toefting drops appeal of assault conviction, will do jail time COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) Former Danish international Stig Toefting dropped his appeal of an assault conviction and will serve a four-month jail sentence, Denmark's TV2 reported Monday. Toefting was convicted in October 2002 of assaulting a pair of restaurant workers during a night out with national squad teammates in the capital, Copenhagen. He was sentenced to four months in prison, but appealed. The hearing was scheduled for April 10. TV2, quoting Toefting's lawyer Anders Nemeth, reported that that 33-year-old midfielder was ready to serve his sentence immediately. Neither Toefting or Nemeth were immediately available for comment. Earlier this month, Toefting said English Premier League club Bolton let him go so he could prepare for the appeal. It was unclear whether Toefting would return to Bolton after serving his sentence. The club said it wasn't aware of Toefting's decision to drop his appeal. Toefting transferred to Bolton in February 2002 from German club Hamburg. Toefting has been convicted before. In 1999 he was given a 20-day suspended sentence for assaulting a fan who berated him for playing with German club Duisburg. The popular player  _  known for his temperament and the words ``No Regret'' tattooed across his chest  _  retired from Denmark's national team after it was knocked out in the second round of the 2002 World Cup.
