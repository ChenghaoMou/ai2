Sharif's wife Tahari Shad Tabussum, 27, brother Zahid Hussain Sharif, 46, and sister Paveen Sharif, 35, made no application for bail at the court, according to local reports. All of them were charged Thursday under Section 38 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which covers failure to disclose information about acts of terrorism, said the reports. The sister was also charged under section 62 of the Terrorism Act which covers aiding and abetting acts of terrorism overseas. Israeli authorities have claimed Sharif, 27, from Derby, was on the run after failing to blow himself up in the attack on a Tel Aviv bar. Three people were killed and about 50 injured when another Briton, Asif Muhammad Hanif, 21, from London, detonated explosives strapped to his body.

He was sentenced to four months in prison, but appealed. The hearing was scheduled for April 10. TV2, quoting Toefting's lawyer Anders Nemeth, reported that that 33-year-old midfielder was ready to serve his sentence immediately. Neither Toefting or Nemeth were immediately available for comment. Earlier this month, Toefting said English Premier League club Bolton let him go so he could prepare for the appeal. It was unclear whether Toefting would return to Bolton after serving his sentence. The club said it wasn't aware of Toefting's decision to drop his appeal. Toefting transferred to Bolton in February 2002 from German club Hamburg. Toefting has been convicted before. In 1999 he was given a 20-day suspended sentence for assaulting a fan who berated him for playing with German club Duisburg.

Pentagon officials said Tuesday they didn't know whether Iraqi President Saddam Hussein died in the U.S. airstrike on a Baghdad neighborhood the day before. The strike destroyed three nearby houses and killed at least two people. U.S. Marines battled snipers as they fought deeper into the capital from the east. They seized the Rasheed Airport and captured enough ammunition for an estimated 3,000 troops. Ominously, they also took a prison where they found U.S. Army uniforms and chemical weapons suits possibly belonging to American POWs. Some army units routed Iraqi fighters from a Republican Guard headquarters inside the capital. Others discovered a 12-room complex inside a cave, complete with white marble floors and fluorescent lighting. Members of the U.S. Army's V Corps opened up a new front by entering Baghdad from the north. The toll on Iraqi civilians four days after Americans first penetrated the Baghdad outskirts is unknown. But the World Health Organization said Baghdad's hospitals were running out of supplies to treat the burns, shrapnel wounds and spinal injuries caused by the fighting.

{"context": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) Malaysia's second highest court on Friday rejected an appeal by jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim against his conviction and nine-year prison sentence for sodomy. A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a verdict by High Court Judge Arifin Jaka nearly three years ago that found Anwar guilty of sodomizing his wife's former driver. Sodomy is a crime in this predominantly Muslim Southeast Asian country. Anwar is expected to appeal again with the Federal Court, Malaysia's highest court. Speaking to reporters after the verdict, Anwar lambasted the judges, saying they had been ``preselected'' by the government to quash his appeal. ``These are spineless judges,'' Anwar said. ``This decision is all scripted.'' The judges also rejected an application by Anwar to be released on bail. But Anwar's lawyers said they were filing a fresh request for bail pending a further appeal. On Monday, Anwar completed his sentence for a separate conviction on corruption charges, after the six-year sentence was reduced by one-third for good behavior. He then began serving the nine-year prison sentence for sodomy, his lawyers said. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar, his former protege, in 1998 following disputes over financial policy.

{"context": "Court suspends independent paper for publishing letters deemed religiously inflammatory KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) A state security court suspended a newspaper critical of the government Saturday after convicting it of publishing religiously inflammatory material, the newspaper's lawyer said. The Khartoum Monitor may not appear for two months and must pay a fine of 1 million Sudanese pounds (about US$400), lawyer Ngor Olang Ngor told The Associated Press. Failure to pay the fine would result in a two-month extension of the suspension. The sentence was the latest in a series of state actions against the Monitor, the only English language daily in Sudan and a leading critic of conditions in the south of the country, where a civil war has been waged for 20 years. Ngor said the paper would pay the fine but it would also appeal the verdict. The court ruling stated that the verdict and sentence would be submitted to the National Press Council, a government-appointed body, for approval, Ngor said. The secretary general of the National Press Council, Hashim el-Jazz, did not answer repeated calls to his cell phone on Saturday. The court convicted the paper of violating article 25 of the Press Law, which prohibits the publication of material that defames religion or incites religiously unacceptable activity. The charges arose from letters-to-the-editor published last month that dealt with religion. One letter claimed that alcohol was not prohibited by Islam. Earlier this week, security police detained the Monitor's managing editor, Nhial Bol, for 24 hours. On his release, he was charged with incitement of public discord for publishing the letters.

As rising instability in Lebanon increases tensions in the Middle East, the Bush administration is arguing with European governments over whether they should designate the Lebanon-based Shiite group Hezbollah a terrorist organization, American and European officials say. The United States is already stepping up pressure on Iran and Syria, Hezbollah's main sponsors. The American rift with Syria deepened this week, with suspicions that Syria might have been behind the assassination of Lebanon's former prime minister in Beirut on Monday. In the past two weeks, the officials said, France has rebuffed appeals by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the Israeli foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, to list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, which would prevent it from raising money in Europe through charity groups. The United States has long called Hezbollah a terrorist organization, but the French, American and European officials said, have opposed doing so, and argue that making such a designation now would be unwise, given the new turbulence in Lebanon. Israeli and American officials say that the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has told them that he, too, regards Hezbollah as a destructive force in the Middle East, one determined to undermine peace talks by supporting militant groups that attack Israelis. Gotta love that. The Palestinian president admits that Hezbollah are a bunch of f-wad terrorists but the French don't agree....No joke.

The woman's parents, William and Nancy Scott, found the decomposing body of the first baby in her closet after they went looking for the source of a foul odor in their house.

In a verdict handed down on Saturday, the judge also ordered Ranjha to pay a fine of 50,000 rupees (about 870 US dollars), they said. Ranjha was accused of tearing down a billboard carrying verses from the Koran in Faisalabad during a Christian demonstration after the city's bishop committed suicide over the 1985 blasphemy law. Faisalabad's Catholic Bishop John Joseph, who had been campaigning against the law, shot himself in the head outside a court in Sahiwal district when the judge convicted Christian Ayub Masih under the law in 1998. Ayub Masih was charged in 1996 with blasphemy for allegedly defending British author Salman Rushdie, whose novel \"The Satanic Verses\" infuriated radical Mulsim clerics who accused the author of defaming Islam. The Pakistani supreme court last year aquitted Ayub Masih, who had denied uttering any word against Islam or the Prophet Mohammad. Blasphemy is punishable by death under the Pakistan Penal Code.

Kristin Scott, the mother, told police she gave birth secretly to both babies at her parents' home in Byrds Creek, Richland County, one of unknown sex in April 2001 and the other, a fullterm girl, January 14. Police arrested her in Abilene, Texas, Saturday where she had moved with a friend June 2. She is being held on 50,000 dollars bail on a charge of first-degree reckless homicide and hiding a corpse in the death of the infant born in January. Scott told police she did not tend to the baby, and it died after 30 minutes. She said the baby had to die, according to the criminal complaint. The woman's parents, William and Nancy Scott, found the decomposing body of the first baby in her closet after they went looking for the source of a foul odor in their house.

Mirjana Markovic, the power behind the scenes during Milosevic's 13-year reign, is accused of illegally providing their grandson's nanny with a state-owned luxury apartment in Belgrade in 2000. The Belgrade district court said that Markovic will be tried along with 10 other Milosevic-era officials who face similar charges of ``inappropriate use of state property'' that carry a sentence of up to five years in jail. The trial will start on March 13, the court said. Milosevic and his wife wielded enormous power in Yugoslavia for more than a decade before he was swept out of power after a popular revolt in October 2000. The post-Milosevic government later extradited him to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, the Netherlands. Since then, many of Milosevic's political and business allies as well as his two children have been accused of crimes.

Anwar claims the charges were fabricated to keep him from challenging Mahathir for power. The government denies this.

Israeli analyst Mark Heller said that ``Hamas is trying to ensure that the road map doesn't go anywhere and that Abu Mazen (Abbas) doesn't go anywhere either.'' The three bombers came from Hebron and at one point studied at the Polytechnic Institute in the city. Two bombers, Fuad Qawasmeh, 18, and Bassem Takrouri, 19, lived in the same Hebron neighborhood and were friends. The Israeli military on Monday demolished the Qawasmeh family home, part of a policy of trying to deter attacks by punishing assailants' relatives. The three bombers released farewell videos, apparently taken in the same wooded area. In frame grabs published in the Yediot Ahronot daily, the three struck identical poses, holding up assault rifles. Each wore a green headband with Quranic verses and an olive-colored vest with pockets for ammunition and grenades.

Toefting was convicted in October 2002 of assaulting a pair of restaurant workers during a night out with national squad teammates in the capital, Copenhagen. He was sentenced to four months in prison, but appealed. The hearing was scheduled for April 10. TV2, quoting Toefting's lawyer Anders Nemeth, reported that that 33-year-old midfielder was ready to serve his sentence immediately. Neither Toefting or Nemeth were immediately available for comment. Earlier this month, Toefting said English Premier League club Bolton let him go so he could prepare for the appeal. It was unclear whether Toefting would return to Bolton after serving his sentence. The club said it wasn't aware of Toefting's decision to drop his appeal. Toefting transferred to Bolton in February 2002 from German club Hamburg. Toefting has been convicted before. In 1999 he was given a 20-day suspended sentence for assaulting a fan who berated him for playing with German club Duisburg. The popular player  _  known for his temperament and the words ``No Regret'' tattooed across his chest  _  retired from Denmark's national team after it was knocked out in the second round of the 2002 World Cup.

WM is affiliated with, but not run or fully supported by, the denomination I've been a part of all my life (UMC). My grandmother (who was Baptist) lived here for a few months before she died in 1995, so I have many connections to the job.

The job's only about 12 miles from home, and I'm going against the bulk of the traffic mornings and afternoons. It all seems perfect and yet...

The authorities have moved the trial venue for security reasons and to allow wider media coverage. Ba'asyir was not officially charged with the Bali bombing last October, but police said he gave his blessing to the Bali perpetrators. Police believed Ba'asyir was the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, the terrorist network in Southeast Asia which is widely blamed for the Bali bombing.

{"context": "Oklahoma played in it's conference title game against a four-loss Colorado team that can't throw the ball. The result was a 40 plus point beatdown, but what did anyone expect? Auburn played 15th ranked Tennessee and was attempting to do one of the toughest things to do in college football: beating a team twice in the same year. With the exception of a 15 yard shanked punt and a punt snap that Kody Bliss missed while having an apparent thrombosis, Auburn led 21-7 at the half and had held UT to 46 yards of offense. While the Auburn running game was held up, Jason Campbell threw it all over the ball field and, when his receivers were covered, he ran for yardage on his own. This despite several late hits to the head, low hits at his knees and ankles, and various other assaults outside the realm of good sportsmanship. Tennessee scored on a pass play that was incorrectly ruled a touchdown, since the ball clearly touched the turf, and that's where the momentum of the game changed. I think it was also at that point that the scoreboard began to reflect Auburn's last title hopes dying as the Oklahoma-Colorado score would have begun showing the beat-down that was occuring. Auburn was tied 21-21 and in jeapordy of losing it most important game ever, but senior QB Jason Campbell would have none of it. Auburn won going away 38-28, and the only place the game looked close was on the scoreboard.

China expressed hopes that both sides would keep the dialogue alive while officials in Moscow and London called for patience in resolving the complex impasse. South Korea and Japan were cautious, with Seoul Foreign Minister Yoon Young-Kwan saying if the North Koreans were telling the truth, it would represent a \"major\" threat to peace in Northeast Asia. US sources with authoritative knowledge of the Beijing meetings said the head of the North Korean delegation Li Gun had confirmed to US envoy James Kelly that the Stalinist state had developed nuclear weapons and hinted it may sell or use them, depending on US actions. \"They said what we always knew, that they do have weapons,\" one US source said. \"That doesn't shock us, we have been saying it. Now they have said it.\" Li also told Kelly that North Korea had gone ahead with reprocessing 8,000 spent fuel rods at its Yongbyon plant, which could produce enough weapons grade plutonium for several more nuclear bombs, said the sources who requested anonymity.

{"context": "Joe had just read a George W. Grayson article in the William & Mary Alumni Magazine , \" Myths About Illegal Immigration .\" Grayson does not cite any Virginia examples, but among the \"myths\" he attempts to explode are that illegal immigrants perform jobs Americans don't want and that they contribute more in taxes and social security than they take from government programs. I personally know a good number of immigrants, both legal and illegal. One fellow, a Brazilian, has done everything by the book. He gets rewarded by having to pay an immigration attorney thousands of dollars while getting yanked around by the Immigration Service... not to mention, he's paying the government thousands in taxes. He gets very frustrated because many of his contemporaries work for cash under the table. They aren't paying lawyers, and they pay nothing into the system. Of course, the Americans who employ illegal immigrants are happy to pay in cash because it means cheaper labor for them. Who benefits? The illegal immigrants themselves, of course. The employers who hire them instead of raising wages to attract native-born Americans and legal immigrants. And families who hire cheap domestic labor, whether to clean the house, wash the laundry or maintain the lawn. Who loses? Poor, native-born Americans who otherwise would be paid higher wages for their manual labor. Legal immigrants like my Brazilian friend, who sometimes feels like a sap for playing by the rules. And the rest of us who won't hire anyone to work for us unless they're paying their taxes, even if it means we pay more.

Joe had just read a George W. Grayson article in the William & Mary Alumni Magazine , \" Myths About Illegal Immigration .\" Grayson does not cite any Virginia examples, but among the \"myths\" he attempts to explode are that illegal immigrants perform jobs Americans don't want and that they contribute more in taxes and social security than they take from government programs. I personally know a good number of immigrants, both legal and illegal. One fellow, a Brazilian, has done everything by the book. He gets rewarded by having to pay an immigration attorney thousands of dollars while getting yanked around by the Immigration Service... not to mention, he's paying the government thousands in taxes. He gets very frustrated because many of his contemporaries work for cash under the table. They aren't paying lawyers, and they pay nothing into the system. Of course, the Americans who employ illegal immigrants are happy to pay in cash because it means cheaper labor for them. Who benefits? The illegal immigrants themselves, of course. The employers who hire them instead of raising wages to attract native-born Americans and legal immigrants. And families who hire cheap domestic labor, whether to clean the house, wash the laundry or maintain the lawn. Who loses? Poor, native-born Americans who otherwise would be paid higher wages for their manual labor. Legal immigrants like my Brazilian friend, who sometimes feels like a sap for playing by the rules.

Toujan Faisal, 54, said she was informed of the refusal by an Interior Ministry committee overseeing election preparations. ``The excuse is invalid because I've been convicted on political not criminal grounds, which doesn't violate my right for contesting the elections,'' Faisal told The Associated Press. Faisal was convicted in May 2002 for publishing false and exaggerated information abroad that harmed the government's reputation and dignity. She was sentenced to 1{ years in jail. But after spending 40 days in prison, Jordan's King Abdullah II pardoned the former legislator known for her harsh criticism of the state. Jordan's electoral law bans Jordanians from contesting the polls if they were convicted of any crime, except political, and sentenced to more than one year in jail. Government officials were not immediately available for comment.

Hu, who was appointed to the top job in March, will meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin during his three-day state visit from May 26 to 28. He will then stay on for a regional summit before heading to Saint Petersburg for celebrations marking the 300th anniversary of the city's founding. \"This upcoming visit to Russia will be my first trip aboard since I became president of China. I plan a thorough exchange of views with President Vladimir Putin on bilateral and important regional and international issues,\" Hu said in an interview with Russia's Interfax news agency. \"Our discussions should strengthen political trust between the two sides and mutually beneficial cooperation to raise Russian-Chinese relations to a new level,\" he added. Putin, who enjoyed a warm relationship with former Chinese president Jiang Zeming, has made efforts to nurture ties with Hu and was the first world leader to go to Beijing to meet him in December when he was president-in-waiting. \"Presidents Vladimir Putin and Hu Jintao have developed good personal contacts, which will undoubtedly facilitate the promotion of the Russian strategic partnership,\" Russia's ambassador to China Igor Rogachyov said, quoted by Interfax.

Victory parades for the troops. I remember covering General Schwarzkopf, the parades in Washington and New York after the first Gulf War. Do you want the troops to be honored in that way when they come back, to have parades in New York, Washington, elsewhere? There's no question but that the troops, the young men and women, did such a superb job that there has to be a way to honor them, and there will be. And General Franks and his team have done just a superb job for our country and for the world, and indeed for the Iraqi people, who have been liberated. What's the best way to do that? In the case of 1991, the task was to go in and get them out of Kuwait, and they did it, and they were properly greeted coming back to the United States. In this instance, it was a very different task. It was to remove that regime, and it's part of a global war on terrorism that is not over. We still have to face the problem of a number of global terrorist networks and terrorist states that exist, that work with those global networks. And on the one hand we will, in fact, find a way to honor the courage and dedication and talent of these young men and women, and we'll do it well. Whether it will be modeled off the 1991 thing, I don't know. I kind of doubt it, because it's such a different circumstance.

She will be the Registration Manager for the Houston Center, accountable for causing registrations into the Landmark Forum. I know this is a huge commitment for her, and I am excited about the difference she will make in my life, my family, and in the lives of the people in this part of the world.

If you have hobbies, the hobbies are about making a difference in the world. This is not an easy thing to take on. The mountain is very steep and hard to climb. It is also incredibly rewarding and fulfilling and gives purpose and meaning to your life. The poet Rilke once said \"the spirit wants only that there be flight, as to who actually accomplishes it, in that she only has a passing interest\".

Toefting was convicted in October 2002 of assaulting a pair of restaurant workers during a night out with national squad teammates in the capital, Copenhagen.

The club said it wasn't aware of Toefting's decision to drop his appeal. Toefting transferred to Bolton in February 2002 from German club Hamburg. Toefting has been convicted before. In 1999 he was given a 20-day suspended sentence for assaulting a fan who berated him for playing with German club Duisburg.

Welch specifically is seeking performance evaluations, correspondence between his estranged wife and partners while she worked at the law firm's office in London, and documents related to her prospects of becoming a partner. Welch also wants details on Jane Beasley Welch's salary, benefits, retirement plan and other compensation paid to her. Michael York, one of Jack Welch's attorneys, called the move routine. A judge ruled in February that depositions in the divorce case will remain confidential. Earlier documents in the case have included embarrassing details about perks Welch received as part of his retirement package from GE at a time when corporate scandals were sparking outrage. The court order was requested by Jack Welch's attorney, Daniel K. Webb, who said Welch would likely be asked about his business dealings, his health and entries in his personal diary. Webb also said details of the breakdowns of the Welches' previous marriages were likely to come up, and cited reports of alleged extramarital affairs by both. Welch has previously failed in an attempt to temporarily seal a financial affidavit.", "question": "Who married Welch?", "answer1": "Suzy Wetlaufer", "answer2": "a partner", "answer3": "Michael York", "answer4": "Jane Beasley Welch"}

{"context": "Joe had just read a George W. Grayson article in the William & Mary Alumni Magazine , \" Myths About Illegal Immigration .\" Grayson does not cite any Virginia examples, but among the \"myths\" he attempts to explode are that illegal immigrants perform jobs Americans don't want and that they contribute more in taxes and social security than they take from government programs. I personally know a good number of immigrants, both legal and illegal. One fellow, a Brazilian, has done everything by the book. He gets rewarded by having to pay an immigration attorney thousands of dollars while getting yanked around by the Immigration Service... not to mention, he's paying the government thousands in taxes. He gets very frustrated because many of his contemporaries work for cash under the table. They aren't paying lawyers, and they pay nothing into the system. Of course, the Americans who employ illegal immigrants are happy to pay in cash because it means cheaper labor for them. Who benefits? The illegal immigrants themselves, of course. The employers who hire them instead of raising wages to attract native-born Americans and legal immigrants. And families who hire cheap domestic labor, whether to clean the house, wash the laundry or maintain the lawn. Who loses? Poor, native-born Americans who otherwise would be paid higher wages for their manual labor. Legal immigrants like my Brazilian friend, who sometimes feels like a sap for playing by the rules. And the rest of us who won't hire anyone to work for us unless they're paying their taxes, even if it means we pay more.

{"context": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) Malaysia's second highest court on Friday rejected an appeal by jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim against his conviction and nine-year prison sentence for sodomy. A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a verdict by High Court Judge Arifin Jaka nearly three years ago that found Anwar guilty of sodomizing his wife's former driver. Sodomy is a crime in this predominantly Muslim Southeast Asian country. Anwar is expected to appeal again with the Federal Court, Malaysia's highest court. Speaking to reporters after the verdict, Anwar lambasted the judges, saying they had been ``preselected'' by the government to quash his appeal. ``These are spineless judges,'' Anwar said. ``This decision is all scripted.'' The judges also rejected an application by Anwar to be released on bail. But Anwar's lawyers said they were filing a fresh request for bail pending a further appeal. On Monday, Anwar completed his sentence for a separate conviction on corruption charges, after the six-year sentence was reduced by one-third for good behavior. He then began serving the nine-year prison sentence for sodomy, his lawyers said. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar, his former protege, in 1998 following disputes over financial policy. Anwar led large protests against Mahathir before he was arrested, charged and convicted on corruption and sodomy charges. Anwar claims the charges were fabricated to keep him from challenging Mahathir for power. The government denies this. Human rights group Amnesty International said Friday's verdict ``represents another step in the further deterioration in the human rights situation in the country.'' ``This decision adds to the already widespread perception that in politically sensitive cases, the independence of the judiciary can no longer be guaranteed,'' the London-based group said in a statement. ``Today, the situation looks much bleaker.''", "question": "Whose sentence was reduced?", "answer1": "Human", "answer2": "A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals", "answer3": "jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim", "answer4": "Anwar's lawyers"}

The seven include former state radio director Tran Mai Hanh and former vice national chief prosecutor Pham Sy Chien, both convicted of receiving bribes, the court official said on condition of anonymity. The trial by a Ho Chi Minh City court was seen as a litmus test of the communist government's resolve to fight widespread corruption. The ``godfather'' of organized crime, Truong Van Cam  _  better known as Nam Cam  _  was convicted of seven crimes, including murder. He was sentenced to face a firing squad, and his lawyer has said he also plans to appeal. Hanh, also a former member of the powerful Communist Party Central Committee, was convicted of receiving US$8,500 in bribes from Nam Cam's family to secure the crime boss' early release from labor camp in 1990s. Hanh was sentenced to 10 years in jail. Chien was convicted of receiving a stereo set worth 27 million dong (US$1,750) from Nam Cam's family and sentenced to six years in jail. Five other people who were sentenced up to five years in jail for crimes such as gambling and receiving bribes have also filed appeals, the official said. A total of 155 defendants stood trial during the three months of proceedings. All but five were convicted. One defendant was acquitted, while the court sent four other cases back to police for further investigation.

Asked who should govern Iraq, Al-Douri said: ``I have nothing to do with that.'' Annan also declined to comment on Thursday's meeting with Al-Douri. With the fall of Baghdad Wednesday, Al-Douri declared ``the game is over'' and expressed hope that the Iraqi people will now be able to live in peace. He said he had not been in touch with Baghdad. Beside meeting with Annan, Al-Douri spent several hours during the late morning and afternoon meeting with ambassadors and diplomats in the Delegate's Lounge. ``I wished him good luck but I don't know what he said to the secretary-general and what will be his next steps,'' said Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa, who talked with Al-Douri before his own meeting with Annan.

Several hours later, dozens of Israeli tanks advanced into the northern Gaza Strip backed by helicopters which fired at least three rockets in the Jabaliya area, Palestinian security sources said. Palestinian medical sources said 60-year-old Mohammed al-Biyari was killed in his home near Jabaliya refugee camp by the rocket fire and another wounded. A second rocket landed in farmlands and the other hit a house inside the refugee camp, but without causing further casualties, Palestinian security sources said. Two 13-year-old children were among those killed in the Haifa bus bombing, Israeli public radio said, adding that most of the victims were youngsters. The army said two soldiers were also among the dead. The bus was ripped to shreds while travelling between a residential area and Haifa university. Of the 33 injured still in hospital late Wednesday, two were in intensive care and six others in serious condition, the radio said. Israel's night-time raid in Gaza involving around 40 tanks and armoured vehicles came after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon convened his security cabinet to discuss a response to the bomb attack. Israeli media said the retaliation was unlikely to be on a scale that would risk disrupting US preparations for war on Iraq.

I checked with a lawyer familiar with Canadian charity law, who explained that it is not permitted to remunerate board members of charities for their service as board members. The prohibition does not apply to directors of nonprofit organizations that are not charities. In the USA, the rules vary from state to state. Some states permit board members of charities to be compensated, but it is generally not done. Donors, funders, and the general public share the view that directors of charities should act gratuitiously. It is permitted everywhere, however, to reimburse directors for necessary expenses incurred in order to serve. If your organization is a charity, you need to check your state law and act very carefully if you are considering paying board members.

And, broad opposition to the U.S.-led attack on Iraq threatens to lead to a backlash by militant Islamists. ``Nearly everybody in Indonesia sees this Iraq war as completely unnecessary and there is widespread public opposition to U.S. policies,'' said Jusuf Wanadi of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta. Close ties between Moscow and Jakarta are not unprecedented. Indonesia relied on Soviet military assistance in the 1950s under Megawati's father and founding President Sukarno, but these were severed after the anti-communist Gen. Suharto seized power in 1965. The United States quickly became the Southeast Asian country's main weapons supplier, and annual arms sales peaked at US$400 million in the 1980s. In 1991, however, the U.S. Congress banned this after Indonesian troops killed hundreds of civilians in East Timor. In 1999, East Timor became free, but only after Indonesian forces laid waste to it as they withdrew after a pro-independence referendum. The shocking level of destruction prompted U.S. lawmakers to expand the ban to cover almost all military ties with Indonesia. Since then some in the Bush administration  _  particularly Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, a former ambassador to Jakarta and a prime architect of the Iraq war  _  have pushed for the ban to be repealed. So far, U.S. lawmakers have reinstated only a limited officer training program. But that's far from enough for Indonesia's generals. ``I think the Indonesian military has finally decided that restrictions and conditionalities from Washington are just not worth it,'' said Juwono Sudarsono, a former defense minister. ``So they want to look for alternative sources for planes, helicopters and other hardware.''

Giuliani, 58, proposed to Nathan, a former nurse, during a November business trip to Paris\t_  five months after he finalized his divorce from Donna Hanover after 20 years of marriage. In interviews last year, Giuliani said Nathan gave him ``tremendous emotional support'' through his treatment for prostate cancer and as he led the city during the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. ``We were close already,'' Giuliani said. ``And then we went through hell together.'' Giuliani and Nathan began appearing in public together in May 2000. Soon after, he announced that he and Hanover were moving toward legal separation. During the legal proceedings leading up to the divorce, a judge ruled that Nathan could not visit Gracie Mansion, the official mayoral residence, as long as Giuliani's children lived there. Giuliani and Hanover have two teenage children, Andrew and Caroline. The divorce settlement called for Giuliani to pay Hanover more than $6.8 million. Hanover, 53, is host of a syndicated television show, ``Famous Homes and Hideaways.'' Last month, she and her fiance  _  an old high school sweetheart  _  invited the press along as they went shopping for wedding bands, saying they are planning a wedding in the New York City area this summer.

The payment, if approved by the courts, would settle a slew of suits by clients over auctions held between 1993 and 2000 outside the United States, it said in a statement. \"Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Sotheby's and Christie's will each pay 20 million dollars,\" said Sotheby's, which operates in 34 countries.

The litigation covers buyers in auctions outside the United States between January 1, 1993 and February 7, 2000, and sellers between September 1, 1995 and February 7, 2000. Similar claims over US-based auctions were settled in an agreement struck in September 2000 for a total of 512 million dollars. In December 2001, a Manhattan jury convicted Sotheby's main shareholder and former chairman Alfred Taubman of entering into a price-fixing agreement with Christie's. Four months later, the billionaire was sentenced to one year in prison and a 7.5-million-dollar fine over the price-fixing, which prosecutors said had cost clients of both firms 400 million dollars.

With the fall of Baghdad Wednesday, Al-Douri declared ``the game is over'' and expressed hope that the Iraqi people will now be able to live in peace. He said he had not been in touch with Baghdad. Beside meeting with Annan, Al-Douri spent several hours during the late morning and afternoon meeting with ambassadors and diplomats in the Delegate's Lounge. ``I wished him good luck but I don't know what he said to the secretary-general and what will be his next steps,'' said Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa, who talked with Al-Douri before his own meeting with Annan. In an interview with The Associated Press Wednesday night, Al-Douri said he will continue to work at the United Nations and had no intention of defecting. ``Defecting from who?'' he asked. ``I think the government has already defected.

{"context": "For my holiday post, I offer a message of hope for the business world. In 1994, I was a graduate student in Boston. I was asked to moderate a panel discussion on social entrepreneurship for a conference at Harvard Business School. The conference was being held by a new group called Students for Responsible Business. I expected to see a small gathering of idealistic, slightly naive MBA students. What I found was a packed room of 200 intelligent, practical,driven idealists. These students were determined to figure out how to use business as a driver for positive social change. I left that room with my eyes open to the possibilities presented by these future business leaders. Fast forward 10 years. Students for Responsible Business is now called Net Impact . In 2004, I had the opportunity to attend their conference hosted by The University of Texas McCombs Business School. Net Impact had grown to include over 9,000 MBA students and alumni. Approximately 900 people attended the 2004 conference. The buzz words flying around the conference included social entrepreneurship, sustainable profitability, working with passion. I met student after student intent on harnessing the forces of business and capitalism to improve the world. These students understand that business is a powerful lever of change in this world. Recently business schools have received their share of criticism for turning out graduates who seem to have lost sight of their responsibility for ethical action. I can tell you that I am seeing a powerful groundswell of change coming from within business schools. It is not coming from the faculty, or the alumni, or the administration. All these groups continue to pay lipservice to topics of social responsibility while avoiding any real innovations in the student experiences.

{"context": "The argument over how rein in the militants and halt violence has been holding up implementation of the road map. The plan calls for parallel steps in the first stage, including a Palestinian crackdown on militants, an Israeli troop pullback from Palestinian towns and a construction freeze in Jewish settlements. Sharon insists the Palestinians make the first move. He was to have discussed his objections with U.S. President George W. Bush this week, but canceled his trip after Sunday's bus bombing. The Palestinians have accepted the plan as is. The latest wave of attacks began Saturday evening when a Hamas bomber blew himself up in a square in the West Bank city of Hebron, killing an Israeli settler and his pregnant wife. On Sunday morning, another Hamas assailant blew up the Jerusalem bus and about half an hour later, a third bomber from the group detonated explosives on the outskirts of Jerusalem, killing only himself. Israeli analyst Mark Heller said that ``Hamas is trying to ensure that the road map doesn't go anywhere and that Abu Mazen (Abbas) doesn't go anywhere either.'' The three bombers came from Hebron and at one point studied at the Polytechnic Institute in the city. Two bombers, Fuad Qawasmeh, 18, and Bassem Takrouri, 19, lived in the same Hebron neighborhood and were friends. The Israeli military on Monday demolished the Qawasmeh family home, part of a policy of trying to deter attacks by punishing assailants' relatives. The three bombers released farewell videos, apparently taken in the same wooded area.

It's a big city, about the size of Philadelphia or thereabouts. Some have said Chicago is a good analogy. Tremendous amount of force needed to control a city of that source, or am a wrong? Well, it depends on the attitude of the populous, which is not clear yet. If the population, in fact, or at least a big part of them like the Shia half of the population, if they want to be liberated, then you can control them with a fairly small force. If, in fact, a lot of people in the city don't want to be liberated and you're never going to know that until you try, then you're going to need a much larger force, and we might end up waiting a couple of weeks for reinforcements. Based on what you've seen so far, what is your sense of that? The Shias are a bit gun shy, if you will, in the south because of what happened in 1991. They rose up, didn't get American support.

The evidence suggested it was the scene of appalling atrocities. The teeth in many of the skulls had been broken, and bones appeared to be wrapped in strips of military uniform. It's not clear how long the bodies had lain here, but they were clearly not from this war. You come to expect everything in war fighting. The coffins were there. It was a bit more of a surprise when I discovered the bags with the human remains inside. Inside a neighboring building, there was evidence of cells and a catalog of photographs of the dead. Most had died from gunshot wounds to the head. Others were mutilated beyond recognition, their faces burned and swollen. Outside, soldiers discovered what they described as a purpose- built shooting gallery, the brickwork behind it riddled with bullets. Identity cards revealed the names of some of the dead.
