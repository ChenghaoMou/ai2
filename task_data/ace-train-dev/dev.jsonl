Toefting was convicted in October 2002 of assaulting a pair of restaurant workers during a night out with national squad teammates in the capital, Copenhagen. He was sentenced to four months in prison, but appealed. The hearing was scheduled for April 10. TV2, quoting Toefting's lawyer Anders Nemeth, reported that that 33-year-old midfielder was ready to serve his sentence immediately. Neither Toefting or Nemeth were immediately available for comment.

{"question": "Who was convicted of corruption?", "context": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) Malaysia's second highest court on Friday rejected an appeal by jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim against his conviction and nine-year prison sentence for sodomy. A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a verdict by High Court Judge Arifin Jaka nearly three years ago that found Anwar guilty of sodomizing his wife's former driver. Sodomy is a crime in this predominantly Muslim Southeast Asian country. Anwar is expected to appeal again with the Federal Court, Malaysia's highest court. Speaking to reporters after the verdict, Anwar lambasted the judges, saying they had been ``preselected'' by the government to quash his appeal. ``These are spineless judges,'' Anwar said. ``This decision is all scripted.'' The judges also rejected an application by Anwar to be released on bail. But Anwar's lawyers said they were filing a fresh request for bail pending a further appeal. On Monday, Anwar completed his sentence for a separate conviction on corruption charges, after the six-year sentence was reduced by one-third for good behavior. He then began serving the nine-year prison sentence for sodomy, his lawyers said. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar, his former protege, in 1998 following disputes over financial policy. Anwar led large protests against Mahathir before he was arrested, charged and convicted on corruption and sodomy charges. Anwar claims the charges were fabricated to keep him from challenging Mahathir for power. The government denies this.

Judge Shahid Rafiq, of the district court in the industrial city of Faisalabad, found Ranjha Masih guilty of defiling Koranic verses during a protest rally by the minority Christian community in 1998. In a verdict handed down on Saturday, the judge also ordered Ranjha to pay a fine of 50,000 rupees (about 870 US dollars), they said. Ranjha was accused of tearing down a billboard carrying verses from the Koran in Faisalabad during a Christian demonstration after the city's bishop committed suicide over the 1985 blasphemy law. Faisalabad's Catholic Bishop John Joseph, who had been campaigning against the law, shot himself in the head outside a court in Sahiwal district when the judge convicted Christian Ayub Masih under the law in 1998. Ayub Masih was charged in 1996 with blasphemy for allegedly defending British author Salman Rushdie, whose novel \"The Satanic Verses\" infuriated radical Mulsim clerics who accused the author of defaming Islam.

Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to Kofi Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned. The informant offered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be used in the genocide campaign. All that the informant wanted in return was protection for himself and his family. But the general needed U.N. authorization to conduct such a raid and save lives. He asked for that approval but the answer came back in a now-infamous \"genocide fax\" from Annan's office. It denied authorization for the mission and told him that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness over to the Rwandan government which was planning the genocide!

The club said it wasn't aware of Toefting's decision to drop his appeal. Toefting transferred to Bolton in February 2002 from German club Hamburg. Toefting has been convicted before. In 1999 he was given a 20-day suspended sentence for assaulting a fan who berated him for playing with German club Duisburg.

Toujan Faisal, 54, said she was informed of the refusal by an Interior Ministry committee overseeing election preparations. ``The excuse is invalid because I've been convicted on political not criminal grounds, which doesn't violate my right for contesting the elections,'' Faisal told The Associated Press. Faisal was convicted in May 2002 for publishing false and exaggerated information abroad that harmed the government's reputation and dignity. She was sentenced to 1{ years in jail. But after spending 40 days in prison, Jordan's King Abdullah II pardoned the former legislator known for her harsh criticism of the state. Jordan's electoral law bans Jordanians from contesting the polls if they were convicted of any crime, except political, and sentenced to more than one year in jail. Government officials were not immediately available for comment.

Toefting was convicted in October 2002 of assaulting a pair of restaurant workers during a night out with national squad teammates in the capital, Copenhagen.

Welch specifically is seeking performance evaluations, correspondence between his estranged wife and partners while she worked at the law firm's office in London, and documents related to her prospects of becoming a partner. Welch also wants details on Jane Beasley Welch's salary, benefits, retirement plan and other compensation paid to her. Michael York, one of Jack Welch's attorneys, called the move routine. A judge ruled in February that depositions in the divorce case will remain confidential. Earlier documents in the case have included embarrassing details about perks Welch received as part of his retirement package from GE at a time when corporate scandals were sparking outrage. The court order was requested by Jack Welch's attorney, Daniel K. Webb, who said Welch would likely be asked about his business dealings, his health and entries in his personal diary.

{"question": "Whose sentence was reduced?", "context": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) Malaysia's second highest court on Friday rejected an appeal by jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim against his conviction and nine-year prison sentence for sodomy. A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a verdict by High Court Judge Arifin Jaka nearly three years ago that found Anwar guilty of sodomizing his wife's former driver. Sodomy is a crime in this predominantly Muslim Southeast Asian country. Anwar is expected to appeal again with the Federal Court, Malaysia's highest court. Speaking to reporters after the verdict, Anwar lambasted the judges, saying they had been ``preselected'' by the government to quash his appeal. ``These are spineless judges,'' Anwar said. ``This decision is all scripted.'' The judges also rejected an application by Anwar to be released on bail. But Anwar's lawyers said they were filing a fresh request for bail pending a further appeal. On Monday, Anwar completed his sentence for a separate conviction on corruption charges, after the six-year sentence was reduced by one-third for good behavior. He then began serving the nine-year prison sentence for sodomy, his lawyers said. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar, his former protege, in 1998 following disputes over financial policy. Anwar led large protests against Mahathir before he was arrested, charged and convicted on corruption and sodomy charges. Anwar claims the charges were fabricated to keep him from challenging Mahathir for power. The government denies this.

The Palestinian leadership said the attack would serve as \"a pretext for Israel's government and occupation army to step up its deadly campaign which caused the deaths of 77 Palestinians in February\". It was the first bomb attack inside Israel since January 5, and came just days after the hawkish Sharon appointed the most right-wing government in Israel's history on a pledge to get tough on security. In the January attack, two Palestinian suicide bombers blew themselves up in central Tel Aviv, killing 23 other people. Israeli government spokesman Avi Pazner called the latest deadly blast a \"very grave attack\" and said the Jewish state would take \"vigorous action against the terrorist organisations\". He told AFP that Israeli intelligence had been dealing with at least 40 tip-offs of impending attacks when the Haifa bus was blown up. US President George W.

The trial by a Ho Chi Minh City court was seen as a litmus test of the communist government's resolve to fight widespread corruption. The ``godfather'' of organized crime, Truong Van Cam _ better known as Nam Cam _ was convicted of seven crimes, including murder. He was sentenced to face a firing squad, and his lawyer has said he also plans to appeal. Hanh, also a former member of the powerful Communist Party Central Committee, was convicted of receiving US$8,500 in bribes from Nam Cam's family to secure the crime boss' early release from labor camp in 1990s. Hanh was sentenced to 10 years in jail. Chien was convicted of receiving a stereo set worth 27 million dong (US$1,750) from Nam Cam's family and sentenced to six years in jail.

{"question": "What country was laid waste?", "context": "Last year's Bali bombings, which killed 202 people, illustrated the threat of terrorism in Indonesia. And, broad opposition to the U.S.-led attack on Iraq threatens to lead to a backlash by militant Islamists. ``Nearly everybody in Indonesia sees this Iraq war as completely unnecessary and there is widespread public opposition to U.S. policies,'' said Jusuf Wanadi of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta. Close ties between Moscow and Jakarta are not unprecedented. Indonesia relied on Soviet military assistance in the 1950s under Megawati's father and founding President Sukarno, but these were severed after the anti-communist Gen. Suharto seized power in 1965. The United States quickly became the Southeast Asian country's main weapons supplier, and annual arms sales peaked at US$400 million in the 1980s. In 1991, however, the U.S. Congress banned this after Indonesian troops killed hundreds of civilians in East Timor. In 1999, East Timor became free, but only after Indonesian forces laid waste to it as they withdrew after a pro-independence referendum. The shocking level of destruction prompted U.S. lawmakers to expand the ban to cover almost all military ties with Indonesia. Since then some in the Bush administration _ particularly Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, a former ambassador to Jakarta and a prime architect of the Iraq war _ have pushed for the ban to be repealed. So far, U.S. lawmakers have reinstated only a limited officer training program.

The payment, if approved by the courts, would settle a slew of suits by clients over auctions held between 1993 and 2000 outside the United States, it said in a statement. \"Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Sotheby's and Christie's will each pay 20 million dollars,\" said Sotheby's, which operates in 34 countries.

On Sunday morning, another Hamas assailant blew up the Jerusalem bus and about half an hour later, a third bomber from the group detonated explosives on the outskirts of Jerusalem, killing only himself. Israeli analyst Mark Heller said that ``Hamas is trying to ensure that the road map doesn't go anywhere and that Abu Mazen (Abbas) doesn't go anywhere either.'' The three bombers came from Hebron and at one point studied at the Polytechnic Institute in the city. Two bombers, Fuad Qawasmeh, 18, and Bassem Takrouri, 19, lived in the same Hebron neighborhood and were friends.

Next week we want to have as many dates as possible set up for her as we can, so we are asking y'all to please talk to your organizations to see if they would be interested in having Marcella come and speak. In the near future we will be expanding this to include all the other organizations that we can contact, but we are just keeping things safe for now. If you are interested in helping out with contacting organizations then please let me know, cause I need all the help I can get. There are 6 sub committees under the organizations committee: Greek (2) Department of Multicultural services (Tasha should have this taken care of) MSC (2, but I think Crystal is taking care of some of this but she still will need some help) Student Activities (3) Academics and colleges (2) International (1) I am going to need that number of people to help with contacting people in these areas, so please let me know asap. So, as I said earlier please just stick to contacting your organizations this weekend and friends you may have in other organizations. I have attached the welcome packet info if they are interested and I have the cheat sheet to use as a guideline for when you talk to them (just in case you don't have them yet).
