(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) It was a discovery that horrified the soldiers who made it. The remains of hundreds of men were found in plastic bags and Unsealed hard-board coffins. British troops found the bodies at an abandoned Iraqi military base on the outskirts of Azubayr. The evidence suggested it was the scene of appalling atrocities. The teeth in many of the skulls had been broken, and bones appeared to be wrapped in strips of military uniform. It's not clear how long the bodies had lain here, but they were clearly not from this war. You come to expect everything in war fighting. The coffins were there. It was a bit more of a surprise when I discovered the bags with the human remains inside. Inside a neighboring building, there was evidence of cells and a catalog of photographs of the dead. Most had died from gunshot wounds to the head. Others were mutilated beyond recognition, their faces burned and swollen. Outside, soldiers discovered what they described as a purpose- built shooting gallery, the brickwork behind it riddled with bullets. Identity cards revealed the names of some of the dead. Forensic specialists will now visit the scene and hope to establish the truth of what happened here and when. (on camera): Today's discovery seems to provide shocking evidence of atrocities under Saddam Hussein's regime. Most people are afraid to talk openly about what's been happening here.

He did a double take, muttered to himself and then looked a third time. He wondered if he had seen correctly - it looked like a pig with a wooden leg! He found the lane to the farm and drove up into the farmyard, where he was met by the farmer. \"Excuse me,\" the traveler said. \"I was just driving by and looking at all your pigs, and I noticed something that I just had to stop and ask about. Tell me, did I see right? Is there really a pig out there with a wooden leg?\" The farmer smiled. \"Oh, that would be old Caesar you saw.

Remarkably, Ferguson held on to the ball, despite being disjoined from his helmet on the hit. After many minutes lying motionless on the field, Ferguson was finally removed via stretcher, giving a thumbs up to the crowd on the way out. The Packers went on to lose the game, but that's not the story here. This was not one of the staged stiff-armed clotheslines you see in professional wrestling broadcasts. This was a vicious, arm cocked and swinging clothesline that literally could have torn Ferguson's head off of his body. The play was immediately flagged, and moments later it was announced that Darius had been ejected, much to the crowd's delight. One sidenote here is that, despite their rabid fandom and the situation, not one thing was thrown at the offending player as he left the field. It would have been easy to bathe him in beer or snowballs or batteries as he left, but the Packer fans are classier than that. To a person, they acted with class, using their voices and not projectiles to express their displeasure. This was the most vicious and blatantly dirty play I have seen in the NFL since Jim McMahon was body slammed to the ground in the mid 80's about five seconds after he had released a pass.

What I found was a packed room of 200 intelligent, practical,driven idealists. These students were determined to figure out how to use business as a driver for positive social change. I left that room with my eyes open to the possibilities presented by these future business leaders. Fast forward 10 years. Students for Responsible Business is now called Net Impact . In 2004, I had the opportunity to attend their conference hosted by The University of Texas McCombs Business School. Net Impact had grown to include over 9,000 MBA students and alumni. Approximately 900 people attended the 2004 conference. The buzz words flying around the conference included social entrepreneurship, sustainable profitability, working with passion. I met student after student intent on harnessing the forces of business and capitalism to improve the world. These students understand that business is a powerful lever of change in this world.

I know CEO/chair duality is a popular cause for corporate governance. However there is little empirical evidence to suggest that separating these roles affects firm performance in either a positive or negative way.

{"id": "rec.games.chess.politics_20041216.1047", "question": "Who took office?", "context": "Turns out the August 2003 crisis was not a crisis Turns out the August 2003 crisis was not a crisis Everyone has heard the story: Beatriz Marinello was elected USCF President on August 11, 2003 in Los Angeles. Immediately after she took office, she found out that the USCF had no money in the bank, zero. The USCF did not even have the money to pay the guaranteed prizes at the just concluded US Open in Los Angeles. Therefore, on August 20, 2003, bravely Beatriz walked into the USCF Offices in New Windsor and immediately fired 17 staff members. John McCrary resigned from the board as a result. Of course, it was just a pure coincidence that the 17 people Beatriz fired were the people she had grown to dislike during the year that she worked for the USCF in 1999-2000. It took six weeks before the USCF paid the guaranteed prizes the prize winners had won at the US Open. I have just found out something that insiders had known for a long time. The USCF did not have zero money in the bank. It had $85,000 in another bank account that nobody knew about. This was not due to any malfeasance. The office accountant for the USCF had set up a separate bank account and had put the entry fees from the US Open into that account. Nobody knew about that separate bank account, except for the accountant herself. When this was discovered, the accountant explained that she was planning to keep the money", "answer1": "nobody", "answer2": "John McCrary", "answer3": "Everyone", "answer4": "Beatriz Marinello"}
{"id": "rec.games.chess.politics_20041217.2111", "question": "Who filed a lawsuit based on New York law?", "context": "I'm not entirely unsympathetic to this, actually. But frankly I think that a whole lot of the problems the USCF has had over the years have had to do with well-intentioned people keeping secrets because bringing them out in the open would harm the USCF, and as a result we have awful habits which hurt the USCF even worse. But if we are going to talk about realism, here is another realistic concern: I predict that, if, in fact, the rumors about the agenda for the Florida meeting prove true, and Marinello resigns as President and is hired as move coordinator, the immediate result of this is that Sam Sloan will file another lawsuit (or amend his current complaint) charging the USCF EB members with self-dealing, violation of the USCF's own bylaws, and every other thing, report us to the IRS, and demand that all USCF moneys which might be used to paid Marinello be frozen. This is not based on any communication from Sam, direct or indirect. It is just logical. If he is willing to file a lawsuit on the basis of New York non-profit organization law, which might or might not be applicable to the USCF, why wouldn't he file a lawsuit on the basis of the USCF's violation of its own bylaws, which unquestionably ARE applicable to the USCF? I wrote a few days ago quoting my own employer association's attorney, who said that courts mostly let associations do what they want UNLESS they violate their own bylaws.

Remember, a corporation is legally a \"person\", distinct from the corporeal persons who govern, manage, and operate the corporation. Thus, the laws applying to the corporate person are the laws of the state where that person \"lives\". David E. Ross (URL:) I use Mozilla as my Web browser because I want a browser that complies with Web standards. See (URL:). It is very legal, and an acceptable policy or practice in Canada to pay an honorarium or stipent for people on boards that are active. Many do this, as they know it is an investment for the time and talents they need. They also know, as do the recipients, the payment is but a percentage of the true worth of the time and effort, but does show respect for what they are recieving. Is there anyone who knows of a precedent for this being done for a non-profit in the U.S.? Thanks! Some Head Start agencies, Community Health Centers, and similar nonprofit organizations serving low-income people have a requirement for \"consumer\" representation on their boards. Transportation cost reimbursement, child care accommodation, provision of meals, etc., can be done either in-kind or in cash. Michael L.
