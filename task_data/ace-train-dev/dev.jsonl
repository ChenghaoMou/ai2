{'context': "U.S. troops tighten grip on capital, U.S. military criticized for media casualties BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) U.S. forces tightened their grip throughout Baghdad, entering the city for the first time from the north, seizing a military airport and battling snipers and Republican Guard fighters. Meanwhile, the U.S. military faced sharp criticism over assaults that killed three foreign journalists. Pentagon officials said Tuesday they didn't know whether Iraqi President Saddam Hussein died in the U.S. airstrike on a Baghdad neighborhood the day before. The strike destroyed three nearby houses and killed at least two people. U.S. Marines battled snipers as they fought deeper into the capital from the east. They seized the Rasheed Airport and captured enough ammunition for an estimated 3,000 troops. Ominously, they also took a prison where they found U.S. Army uniforms and chemical weapons suits possibly belonging to American POWs. Some army units routed Iraqi fighters from a Republican Guard headquarters inside the capital. Others discovered a 12-room complex inside a cave, complete with white marble floors and fluorescent lighting. Members of the U.S. Army's V Corps opened up a new front by entering Baghdad from the north. The toll on Iraqi civilians four days after Americans first penetrated the Baghdad outskirts is unknown. But the World Health Organization said Baghdad's hospitals were running out of supplies to treat the burns, shrapnel wounds and spinal injuries caused by the fighting. Iraqi officials, however, remained defiant, saying Iraq's forces would never surrender to American forces: ``They will be burnt,'' said Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf. In central Baghdad, a Reuters cameraman and a cameraman for Spain's Telecinco died when an American tank fired on the Palestine Hotel.", 'question': 'Who captured ammunition at the Rasheed Airport?', 'answer1': 'three foreign journalists', 'answer2': 'U.S. Marines', 'answer3': 'snipers', 'answer4': "the U.S. Army's V Corps"}
{'context': "Milosevic's wife to face trial BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro (AP) Slobodan Milosevic's wife will go on trial next week on charges of mismanaging state property during the former president's rule, a court said Thursday. Mirjana Markovic, the power behind the scenes during Milosevic's 13-year reign, is accused of illegally providing their grandson's nanny with a state-owned luxury apartment in Belgrade in 2000. The Belgrade district court said that Markovic will be tried along with 10 other Milosevic-era officials who face similar charges of ``inappropriate use of state property'' that carry a sentence of up to five years in jail. The trial will start on March 13, the court said. Milosevic and his wife wielded enormous power in Yugoslavia for more than a decade before he was swept out of power after a popular revolt in October 2000. The post-Milosevic government later extradited him to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, the Netherlands. Since then, many of Milosevic's political and business allies as well as his two children have been accused of crimes.

That's one of those introspective times where it's just -- it's just an introspective time, not a public time. Duke Cunningham was a Vietnam fighter ace shooting down five enemy planes. After his first, he returned to a ship deck full of sailors and crew cheering, shaking his hand, pushing in to slap his back. And one of the guys looked at me and says: Duke, what's it like to kill somebody? And, all of a sudden, bang, it just hit me. You don't think about those things. And it's removed. It's far off. It's not in close. And I went to the priest, because it bothered me. I knew I could do it again. But I didn't know it was going to bother me as much as it did. And it still does. Of all the wounds time does not heal, the ones that fester deep in the soul are the wounds you inflict. It's not something that civilized people do. You don't -- it's just not -- it's not a matter of being tormented, but troubled in the sense that that's not what we do, unless we're called upon to do it, under the most extreme set of circumstances. War may sometimes be a necessary thing, but it can never be a natural thing. Training bridges that gap. Sergeant Chuck Hagel was seriously wounded twice in Vietnam.

In court papers filed this week in state Supreme Court in New York, Welch requested a deposition next month of David Heleniak, a senior partner in the law firm of Shearman & Sterling in New York. He also wants to subpoena all documents maintained in Jane Beasley Welch's personnel file by Shearman & Sterling, a prestigious corporate law firm where she worked before she married Welch. Welch specifically is seeking performance evaluations, correspondence between his estranged wife and partners while she worked at the law firm's office in London, and documents related to her prospects of becoming a partner. Welch also wants details on Jane Beasley Welch's salary, benefits, retirement plan and other compensation paid to her. Michael York, one of Jack Welch's attorneys, called the move routine. A judge ruled in February that depositions in the divorce case will remain confidential. Earlier documents in the case have included embarrassing details about perks Welch received as part of his retirement package from GE at a time when corporate scandals were sparking outrage. The court order was requested by Jack Welch's attorney, Daniel K. Webb, who said Welch would likely be asked about his business dealings, his health and entries in his personal diary. Webb also said details of the breakdowns of the Welches' previous marriages were likely to come up, and cited reports of alleged extramarital affairs by both.

Toefting was convicted in October 2002 of assaulting a pair of restaurant workers during a night out with national squad teammates in the capital, Copenhagen. He was sentenced to four months in prison, but appealed. The hearing was scheduled for April 10. TV2, quoting Toefting's lawyer Anders Nemeth, reported that that 33-year-old midfielder was ready to serve his sentence immediately. Neither Toefting or Nemeth were immediately available for comment. Earlier this month, Toefting said English Premier League club Bolton let him go so he could prepare for the appeal. It was unclear whether Toefting would return to Bolton after serving his sentence. The club said it wasn't aware of Toefting's decision to drop his appeal. Toefting transferred to Bolton in February 2002 from German club Hamburg. Toefting has been convicted before. In 1999 he was given a 20-day suspended sentence for assaulting a fan who berated him for playing with German club Duisburg. The popular player  _  known for his temperament and the words ``No Regret'' tattooed across his chest  _  retired from Denmark's national team after it was knocked out in the second round of the 2002 World Cup.

Toefting was convicted in October 2002 of assaulting a pair of restaurant workers during a night out with national squad teammates in the capital, Copenhagen. He was sentenced to four months in prison, but appealed. The hearing was scheduled for April 10. TV2, quoting Toefting's lawyer Anders Nemeth, reported that that 33-year-old midfielder was ready to serve his sentence immediately. Neither Toefting or Nemeth were immediately available for comment. Earlier this month, Toefting said English Premier League club Bolton let him go so he could prepare for the appeal. It was unclear whether Toefting would return to Bolton after serving his sentence. The club said it wasn't aware of Toefting's decision to drop his appeal. Toefting transferred to Bolton in February 2002 from German club Hamburg. Toefting has been convicted before. In 1999 he was given a 20-day suspended sentence for assaulting a fan who berated him for playing with German club Duisburg. The popular player  _  known for his temperament and the words ``No Regret'' tattooed across his chest  _  retired from Denmark's national team after it was knocked out in the second round of the 2002 World Cup.

For an idea, here is CNN's Candy Crowley with some war stories. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) They are, we are told, well trained. This is a messy business. There's nothing very pretty about the training that you take to prepare you for combat, because it is to kill people. In the spring of 1970, a squad of U.S. soldiers spotted a small unit of Viet Cong that had been circling for days. Staff Sergeant Tom Ridge opened fire. A Viet Cong soldier dropped dead. (on camera): Did you at the time or have you since looked back and pondered on killing someone? Mm-hmm. And what's that like? That's one of those introspective times where it's just -- it's just an introspective time, not a public time. Duke Cunningham was a Vietnam fighter ace shooting down five enemy planes. After his first, he returned to a ship deck full of sailors and crew cheering, shaking his hand, pushing in to slap his back. And one of the guys looked at me and says: Duke, what's it like to kill somebody? And, all of a sudden, bang, it just hit me. You don't think about those things. And it's removed. It's far off.

At the Pentagon briefing today, General Stanley McChrystal said that it looked a lot like terrorism. It looks and feels like terrorism and what it requires is units to conduct forced production activities which they are prepared and do all the time but clearly when you see a tactic like this, it requires strict adherence or adjustments to your tactics, techniques and procedures to ensure that places like checkpoints are not vulnerable.

Toefting was convicted in October 2002 of assaulting a pair of restaurant workers during a night out with national squad teammates in the capital, Copenhagen. He was sentenced to four months in prison, but appealed. The hearing was scheduled for April 10. TV2, quoting Toefting's lawyer Anders Nemeth, reported that that 33-year-old midfielder was ready to serve his sentence immediately. Neither Toefting or Nemeth were immediately available for comment. Earlier this month, Toefting said English Premier League club Bolton let him go so he could prepare for the appeal. It was unclear whether Toefting would return to Bolton after serving his sentence. The club said it wasn't aware of Toefting's decision to drop his appeal. Toefting transferred to Bolton in February 2002 from German club Hamburg. Toefting has been convicted before. In 1999 he was given a 20-day suspended sentence for assaulting a fan who berated him for playing with German club Duisburg. The popular player  _  known for his temperament and the words ``No Regret'' tattooed across his chest  _  retired from Denmark's national team after it was knocked out in the second round of the 2002 World Cup.

You do what you're there to do. And, in Vietnam, it was body count. Training is what keeps you running toward the front while trucks loaded with dead bodies pass you, going the other way. It's hard to explain what training can do. Training sets your mind to respond not to common sense and judgment, but to training. You really don't have time to think: I'm going the wrong way. I should be going the other way. Later, when he was wounded and trapped behind enemy lines in Korea, Staff Sergeant Charlie Rangel led 40 men, fighting their way to safety. He won a Bronze Star.
